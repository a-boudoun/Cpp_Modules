 upper_bound member function of the std::map container in C++ that allows
  you to find the iterator pointing to the first element in the
   map that is greater than a given key.

 lower_bound is a member function of std::map that allows you to 
 find the iterator pointing to the first element in the map that 
 is not less than a given key, using a binary search algorithm 


 In other words, lower_bound returns the position of the element 
 that is equal to or greater than the given key, whereas upper_bound 
 returns the position of the element that is strictly greater than the 
 given key.
